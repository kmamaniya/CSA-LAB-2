Cache Simulator for MIPS ISA

This simulation emulates the L1 and L2 cache whose configurations are defined in the cacheconfig.txt file. The simulation traces the data requests mentioned in the trace_small.txt and trace.txt file and generates a hit or a miss output.

The caches are write-through, direct and fully associative associative and non inclusive type.

The outputs are generated with a ".out" extention.
